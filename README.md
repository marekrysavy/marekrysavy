### 🟨 ABOUT ME

**I help IT teams increase reliability, streamline systems, and sleep better.**

My goal is simple: fewer incidents, relevant data without noise, and zero manual routine. I bridge the gap between complex infrastructure and clear, actionable insights—both as a Certified Trainer at **initMAX** and as a **Freelance Automation Architect**.

### 🟨 MY PHILOSOPHY

**Technology is a tool, not the goal.**

I prefer **open-source solutions** and simplicity over complexity. My first step is always to understand your actual needs—only then do I propose a solution that makes sense.

> *"Routine belongs to robots, humans create!"*

### 🟨 HOW I CAN HELP YOU

* **MONITORING & ARCHITECTURE (Zabbix)**
  I don't just "install Zabbix." I design monitoring architectures that scale. I help you set up alerting that provides value instead of spam, ensuring you solve problems before they impact your customers.

* **AUTOMATION & INTEGRATION (n8n, Ansible)**
  I connect tools that normally don't talk to each other. Using n8n and Ansible, I automate deployment and operational workflows. I turn manual "clicks" into code, freeing your team from the tasks nobody wants to do.

* **DATA WORKFLOWS (Apache NiFi)**
  Monitoring is useless without good data. I handle complex data flows, ensuring the transfer, cleaning, and transformation of data to obtain quality inputs for your decision-making.
