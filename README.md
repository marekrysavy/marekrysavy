### 🟨 ABOUT ME

**My goal is to help IT teams increase system reliability, streamline maintenance, and sleep better because of it (even though we all know that we in IT don't need to sleep 😅).**

The result is simple: better visibility, fewer incidents, relevant data without noise, and zero manual routine.

**I dislike it when every system is a unique "original" built differently every time.**

I like it when things have order. I build systems so that even someone seeing them for the first time, or taking over administration after me, can quickly orient themselves. Maintenance shouldn't be detective work trying to figure out "how was this actually done," but a straightforward process you’ll still understand a year from now.

I apply this approach everywhere, both as part of the initMAX team and when building automations as a freelance architect.

I resonate most with people who want their systems clean, organized, and functional, from IT Managers to DevOps teams and Administrators.

### 🟨 HOW I CAN HELP YOU

* **MONITORING & ARCHITECTURE (Zabbix)**
  I don't just "install software." I design monitoring architectures that make sense. I help you set up alerting that provides value instead of spam, ensuring you solve problems before they impact your customers.

* **AUTOMATION & INTEGRATION (n8n, Ansible)**
  I connect tools that normally don't talk to each other. Using n8n and Ansible, I automate deployment and operational workflows. I turn manual "clicking" into code, freeing your team from the tasks nobody wants to do.

* **DATA WORKFLOWS (Apache NiFi)**
  Monitoring is useless without good data. I handle complex data flows, ensuring the transfer, cleaning, and transformation of data so you have the best foundation for your decision-making.
